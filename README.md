# Cluster-finder

Use the cluster finder class to go from the raw year.csv data to a new file with the specific cluster you want. The new file will be in the form of (year)cluster(cluster#).csv, so year 2014 with cluster 31 is 2014cluster31.csv

Use the other class to go from the above output to one with only the specified columns.
input is in the form of aboves output, and output is in the form of  (year)cluster(cluster#)Selected.csv such as 2014cluster31Selected.csv
